# Roll Number Generator

### Description
This C++ program assigns unique roll numbers to students. Each roll number is in the format `23P-100X`, where `X` increments with each new student. The program uses a class `GenerateRollNumber` to handle both student names and roll number generation. A nice and tidy way to keep track of your students! ðŸŽ“

### Features
- Unique roll numbers for each student.
- Roll numbers start at 1001 and increment automatically.
- Simple display function to show student details.

### How It Works
1. **Enter Student Names**: The user enters names for the students.
2. **Generate Roll Numbers**: The program generates roll numbers automatically.
3. **Display Info**: Displays the student's name and unique roll number.
